In many cases, localization measurements are only available sporadically after the AUV comes to the sea surface. Since the motion of AUVs is often affected by unknown underwater flow fields, the sporadic localization measurements carry information of the underwater flow field. Motion tomography (MT) algorithms have been developed to compute a underwater flow map based on the sporadic localization measurements.  This paper extends MT by introducing Laplacian regularization in to the problem formulation and the MT algorithm.   Laplacian regularization enforces smoothness in the spatial distribution of the underwater flow field. The resulted Laplacian regularized motion tomography (RMT) algorithm converges to achieve a finite error bounded. The performance of the RMT and other variants of MT are compared through the method of data resolution analysis. The improved performance of RMT is confirmed by experimental data collected from underwater glider ocean sensing experiments.","tags":["Flow mapping"],"title":"Laplacian Regularized Motion Tomography for Underwater Vehicle Flow Mapping with Sporadic Localization Measurements","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yingke Li","Mengxue Hou","Enlu Zhou","Fumin Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1688169600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688169600,"objectID":"c4f4c86898967fec0764ad981befe9a4","permalink":"www.mengxuehou.com/publication/acc_search/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.mengxuehou.com/publication/acc_search/","section":"publication","summary":"The process-aware source seeking (PASS) problem in flow fields aims to find an informative trajectory to reach an unknown source location while taking the energy consumption in the flow fields into consideration. Taking advantage of the existing methods on flow field partition, this paper formulates this problem as a task and motion planning (TAMP) problem and proposes a bi-level hierarchical planning framework to decouple the planning of inter-region transition and inner-region trajectory by introducing inter-region junctions. An integrated strategy is utilized to enable efficient upper-level planning by investigating the optimal solution of the lower-level planner. In order to leverage the triggering rate and the performance, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism is introduced to decide the triggering conditions for both measurements and re-plans.

The VITE model can be viewed as a special reset controller used by the human to generate wand movements that effectively reduce the overshoot of blimp motion.

These analytical formulas enable us to study the convergence of the MT algorithm, and we prove that the estimated trajectory and measured trajectory end positions converge as the MT algorithm proceeds. Experimental results are collected on the Georgia Tech Miniature Autonomous Blimps to demonstrate that the MT algorithm can be applied to reconstruct a wind field in an indoor environment using nothing but sparse position measurements. We further validate the MT algorithm using data collected by an underwater glider deployed in the South Atlantic Bight.

Underwater navigation, for example, requires that a glider must periodically surface and re-localize in order to ensure adequate progress is being made. Such conditions may be directly encoded in Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planners to ensure that glider actions are valid over the execution of a plan. However, HTN planners may not be able to find good solutions when actions have uncertain costs, such as when a glider is disturbed by a flow field.

The data source to the filter combines both the Eulerian flow map with the Lagrangian mobile sensor data stream. The depth-averaged flow is modeled as two components, the tidal and the non-tidal flow component. The tidal flow is modeled with ADCIRC (Advanced Three-Dimensional Circulation Model), while the non-tidal flow field is modeled by a set of spatial basis functions and their time series coefficients. The spatial basis functions are the principal modes derived by performing EOF (Empirical Orthogonal Functions) analysis on the historical surface flow field measured by high frequency radar (HFR), and the temporal coefficients of the spatial basis function are modeled by an LSTM neural network. The Kalman Filter is performed to combine the dynamics derived from the LSTM network, and the observations from the glider flow estimation data. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed data assimilation method can give flow field prediction of reasonable accuracy.","tags":["Environmental state estimation"],"title":"An LSTM based Kalman Filter for Spatio-temporal Ocean Currents Assimilation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mengxue Hou","Qiuyang Tao","Paul Varnell","Fumin Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1561939200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561939200,"objectID":"72210adeb1424686b1bcc444bd2d48a0","permalink":"www.mengxuehou.com/publication/ccta2019/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.mengxuehou.com/publication/ccta2019/","section":"publication","summary":"We investigate interaction  between human and a miniature autonomous blimp, by letting the human  control position of the blimp through pointing motion. The blimp is controlled by a position feedback controller, with the reference position set to the position of pointer. We observe that the blimp can follow the  pointing motion, and reach certain target position. Since the human intention represented by the desired target position for the blimp is not measurable during the process, the Vector Integration to Endpoint (VITE) model is applied to model the dynamics of human pointing motion and  to identify the hidden human intention. Stability analysis shows that the closed-loop human-blimp dynamics are exponentially stable. Experimental data verifies that the VITE model is applicable to model human blimp interaction in 3D space, and the human intention can be identified from trajectories of the blimp and pointer movements.","tags":["human robot interaction"],"title":"Modeling Pointing Tasks in Human-Blimp Interactions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mengxue Hou","Haoyan Zhai","Haomin Zhou","Fumin Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1561939200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561939200,"objectID":"62a77b89dd90bee5e2c9a04a278647fb","permalink":"www.mengxuehou.com/publication/oceans22019/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.mengxuehou.com/publication/oceans22019/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we present a flow field partition method that extracts the key features, which are the spatial and temporal variation of the flow field. The partition method is developed based on K-means algorithm. In the case where the temporal pattern of the flow field contains only a periodic tidal component, we propose an algorithm that partitions the flow field into static clusters of piece-wise constant flow, by performing K-means clustering over the time-averaged flow field. Then the method is extended to partitioning the flow field into clusters of uniform time-varying flow, by fitting the spatially averaged flow in each static partitioned region to a parametric flow model. Simulation results of partitioning both a simulated jet flow field, as well as the ocean surface flow data into time-invariant and time-varying uniform flow are presented to demonstrate that the proposed method can represent the true flow field with significantly less amount of data. Result of using Method of Evolving Junctions to plan the time-optimal path in the partitioned flow field is also presented to demonstrate that the proposed flow partitioning method can be applied to facilitate path planning, and can reduce the path planning computational cost.","tags":["planning"],"title":"Partitioning Ocean Flow Field for Underwater Vehicle Path Planning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mengxue Hou"],"categories":[],"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image(\u0026#39;https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#34;Welcome to Academic!\u0026#34;) Welcome to Academic!

Such features result in the following research questions:\nCognizant: how to represent the agent’s knowledge in an unstructured environment, without a pre-defined set of scene parameters?\nTaskable: how to efficiently discover useful multi-modal distributed strategies for human-robot teams?\nAdaptive: how to learn from past sensory data to build skills that can adapt over time to the particularities of the environment?\nIn this context, my research focuses on foundational advances in robotics and autonomy. I aim to devise practical, computationally-efficient, and provably-correct algorithms that prepare autonomous systems working synergistically with human operators to explore unknown, unstructured and dynamic environments. I will also seek to develop robotic platforms to validate the autonomy algorithms. The underlying hypothesis in my research is that the interactions between agents and the environment provide rich information: on one hand, the robot can leverage its actions and observed effects to train a high-fidelity prediction model (Thrust A). The learned model enables planning and control synergies of interaction policy for human-robot team (Thrust B). On the other hand, the robot can also use the historical perception data to directly learn the skills to achieve efficient sensorimotor understanding and planning (Thrust C).\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"e8f8d235e8e7f2efd912bfe865363fc3","permalink":"www.mengxuehou.com/project/example/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.mengxuehou.com/project/example/","section":"project","summary":"Outline of my research interests","tags":["robotics"],"title":"My research focuses","type":"project"}]
