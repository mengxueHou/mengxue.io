In many cases, localization measurements are only available sporadically after the AUV comes to the sea surface. Since the motion of AUVs is often affected by unknown underwater flow fields, the sporadic localization measurements carry information of the underwater flow field. Motion tomography (MT) algorithms have been developed to compute a underwater flow map based on the sporadic localization measurements.  This paper extends MT by introducing Laplacian regularization in to the problem formulation and the MT algorithm.   Laplacian regularization enforces smoothness in the spatial distribution of the underwater flow field. The resulted Laplacian regularized motion tomography (RMT) algorithm converges to achieve a finite error bounded. The performance of the RMT and other variants of MT are compared through the method of data resolution analysis. The improved performance of RMT is confirmed by experimental data collected from underwater glider ocean sensing experiments.","tags":["Marine Autonomy","Inverse Problems"],"title":"Laplacian Regularized Motion Tomography for Underwater Vehicle Flow Mapping with Sporadic Localization Measurements","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mengxue Hou","Tony X.

Underwater navigation, for example, requires that a glider must periodically surface and re-localize in order to ensure adequate progress is being made. Such conditions may be directly encoded in Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planners to ensure that glider actions are valid over the execution of a plan. However, HTN planners may not be able to find good solutions when actions have uncertain costs, such as when a glider is disturbed by a flow field. We propose a bounded cost HTN planner that leverages a modified potential search method in order to find good navigation plans that satisfy user-defined constraints. Simulation results are presented to validate the approach.","tags":["Automated Planning","Marine Autonomy"],"title":"Bounded Cost HTN Planning for Marine Autonomy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qiuyang Tao","Mengxue Hou","Fumin Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1586217600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586217600,"objectID":"84b034bb876231df82912ab07a8b6d94","permalink":"www.mengxuehou.com/publication/icarcv2020/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.mengxuehou.com/publication/icarcv2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Swing oscillation is widely observed among indoor miniature autonomous blimps (MABs) due to their underactuated design and unique aerodynamic shape. A detailed dynamics model is critical for investigating this undesired movement and designing controllers to stabilize the oscillation. This paper presents a motion model that describes the coupled translational and rotational movements of a typical indoor MAB with saucer shaped envelope. The kinematics and dynamic model of the MAB are simplified from the six-degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) Newton–Euler equations of underwater vehicles. The model is then reduced to 3-DOF given the symmetrical design of the MAB around its vertical axis.

The depth-averaged flow is modeled as two components, the tidal and the non-tidal flow component. The tidal flow is modeled with ADCIRC (Advanced Three-Dimensional Circulation Model), while the non-tidal flow field is modeled by a set of spatial basis functions and their time series coefficients. The spatial basis functions are the principal modes derived by performing EOF (Empirical Orthogonal Functions) analysis on the historical surface flow field measured by high frequency radar (HFR), and the temporal coefficients of the spatial basis function are modeled by an LSTM neural network. The Kalman Filter is performed to combine the dynamics derived from the LSTM network, and the observations from the glider flow estimation data.

We observe that the blimp can follow the  pointing motion, and reach certain target position. Since the human intention represented by the desired target position for the blimp is not measurable during the process, the Vector Integration to Endpoint (VITE) model is applied to model the dynamics of human pointing motion and  to identify the hidden human intention. Stability analysis shows that the closed-loop human-blimp dynamics are exponentially stable.

The partition method is developed based on K-means algorithm. In the case where the temporal pattern of the flow field contains only a periodic tidal component, we propose an algorithm that partitions the flow field into static clusters of piece-wise constant flow, by performing K-means clustering over the time-averaged flow field. Then the method is extended to partitioning the flow field into clusters of uniform time-varying flow, by fitting the spatially averaged flow in each static partitioned region to a parametric flow model. Simulation results of partitioning both a simulated jet flow field, as well as the ocean surface flow data into time-invariant and time-varying uniform flow are presented to demonstrate that the proposed method can represent the true flow field with significantly less amount of data. Result of using Method of Evolving Junctions to plan the time-optimal path in the partitioned flow field is also presented to demonstrate that the proposed flow partitioning method can be applied to facilitate path planning, and can reduce the path planning computational cost.","tags":["Model Reduction","Marine Autonomy"],"title":"Partitioning Ocean Flow Field for Underwater Vehicle Path Planning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mengxue Hou"],"categories":[],"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image(\u0026#39;https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#34;Welcome to Academic!\u0026#34;) Welcome to Academic!

Performing path tracking control with instantaneous flow leads to less path tracking error when the spatially varying flow is of relatively high frequency, but it produces larger path tracking error if the spatially varying flow is of low frequency.

The novel iFFDL data model is built along the dynamic operation points of the controlled plant using the concept called pseudo gradient (PG), where the exogenous disturbance is regarded as an element of pseudo gradient and it can be estimated merely using measured input and output data of the controlled plant. Then, the MFAC scheme is designed based on the proposed iFFDL data model according to a cost function of control input. By virtue of the proposed iFFDL method, the possible complicated behavior of the PG for the original nonlinear system caused by the exogenous disturbance may be better captured and dispersed. As a result, the proposed iFFDL-MFAC can deal with the exogenous disturbance more effectively and gives better control performance comparing with the prototype MFAC. Simulation results illustrate the correctness and effectiveness of the iFFDL-MFAC scheme.","tags":["Data-driven Control"],"title":"An improved full-form-dynamic-linearization based MFAC for a class of nonlinear systems with exogenous disturbance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mengxue Hou","Shangtai Jin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1431043200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1431043200,"objectID":"6977f9063fb33dd51d72d544d8c11439","permalink":"www.mengxuehou.com/publication/ascc2015/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.mengxuehou.com/publication/ascc2015/","section":"publication","summary":"IData-driven control (DDC) is very suitable for practical industrial processes and has attracted much attention of researchers and engineers because it does not depend on an accurate mathematical model of a controlled plant. In this paper, three typical on-line DDC methods, model free adaptive control (MFAC), model free control (MFC), and active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) are designed for the planar manipulator with 1 rotary joint (PM1R). In order to implement the proposed control methods on MATLAB platform, the discrete non-linear model of PM1R and discrete control laws for MFC and ADRC are also derived. The similarity and difference among three DDC methods are discussed briefly and the simulation comparisons among these three DDC methods are given to support the conclusions.","tags":["Data-driven Control"],"title":"Simulation comparison among three data-driven control methods for the planar manipulator","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Description\nRealizing the dreams of autonomy requires autonomous systems that learn to make good decisions.
