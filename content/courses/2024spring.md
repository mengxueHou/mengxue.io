**Description** 

This course introduces students to the concept of information carrying electrical signals and how as Electrical Engineers we can create, manipulate, transmit and receive information by electronic means. The course covers, basic linear circuit analysis; elementary signal theory; time and frequency-domain analysis; and the sampling theorem. The course will explore applications of these techniques to real-world problems.
