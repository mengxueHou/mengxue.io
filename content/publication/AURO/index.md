abstract: We propose an algorithm using method of evolving junctions to solve the optimal path planning problems with piece-wise constant flow fields. In such flow fields, we prove that the optimal trajectories, with respect to a convex Lagrangian in the objective function, must be formed by piece-wise constant velocity motions. Taking advantage of this property, we transform the infinite dimensional optimal control problem into a finite dimensional optimization and use intermittent diffusion to solve the problems. The algorithm is proven to be complete. At last, we demonstrate the performance of the algorithm with various simulation examples.
