abstract: This paper utilizes an anomaly detection algorithm to check if underwater gliders are operating normally in the unknown ocean environment. Glider pilots can be warned of the detected glider anomaly in real time, thus taking over the glider appropriately and avoiding further damage to the glider. The adopted algorithm is validated by two valuable sets of data in real glider deployments, the University of South Florida (USF) glider Stella and the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (SkIO) glider Angus.
