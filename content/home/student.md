I am actively looking for talented graduate/undergrad students & postdoc fellows interested in robotics, control & learning.

**Prospective Ph.D. Students:** I have several Ph.D. positions in Electrical Engineering at the University of Notre Dame starting Fall 2023 or Spring 2024. Strong candidates should be self-motivated, passionate about research, interested in robotics, and have strong programming skills. Ph.D. students at Notre Dame are typically fully funded with full tuition, health insurance, travel funding opportunities, and a generous stipend. Candidates with ANY of the following qualifications would be particularly encouraged: (1) prior experience with robotics or control research; (2) knowledge in machine learning & optimization; (3) mechatronics design & circuits design; (4) programming skills in matlab, ROS, python.
Interested individuals may contact me with the following information: (1) your CV; (2) a copy of your transcripts; (3) a brief description of your background and research interests; and (4) publications or writing samples (course papers are okay) if available. The subject of the email should start with “[PROSPECTIVE-STUDENT]”. Those who provide description in the email of how your expertise matches my prior and current work will give special considerations.
