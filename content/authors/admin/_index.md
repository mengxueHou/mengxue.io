# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research interests include robotic autonomy, mobile sensor networks, and human robot interaction. I aim to devise practical, computationally-efficient, and provably-correct algorithms that prepare robotic systems to be **cognizant**, **taskable**, and **adaptive**, and can collaborate with human operators to co-exist in a complex, ever-changing and unknown environment.

I received B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://ee.sjtu.edu.cn/en/Default.aspx), Shanghai, China, in 2016, and PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://ece.gatech.edu/), Atlanta, GA, USA in 2022, advised by Prof. [Fumin Zhang](https://fumin.ece.gatech.edu/). Starting from 2022, I am a [Lillian Gilbreth Postdoc Fellow](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Engr/Research/GilbrethFellowships#Mengxue-Hou-intro), in College of Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, USA,
 advised by Prof. [Shaoshuai Mou](https://engineering.purdue.edu/AAE/people/ptProfile?resource_id=124981) and Prof. [Shreyas Sundaram](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~sundara2/index.html).   My research interests include robotic autonomy, mobile sensor networks, and human robot interaction. I aim to devise practical, computationally-efficient, and provably-correct algorithms that prepare robotic systems to be **cognizant**, **taskable**, and **adaptive**, and can **collaborate with humans** to co-exist in a complex, ever-changing and unknown environment.
 
 **P.S. Pronounciation of my first name is "mengshway". You can also call me Meng.**

**Prospective Students & Postdoc:** I will start as tenure-track assistant professor at EE department, University of Notre Dame at 2023 fall. I am actively looking for talented graduate/undergrad students & postdoc fellows interested in **robotics, control & learning**. Send me an email if you are interested!
